The original Python code can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython) of the Book's source code.

## Goal
Apply features from modern C++ wherever possible.

## Implementation details
### Chapter1
* `fib4.py` is an implementation that uses Python's decorators, so porting is omitted.
* `fib6.py` is an implementation that uses Python's generators, so porting is omitted.

### Chapter4
* `priority_queue.py` can be replaced with `std::priority_queue` provided by the C++ Standard Template Library, so porting is omitted.
