# Classical Computer Science Problems in C++
This is a C++ porting of 'Classic Computer Problems in Python' by David Kopec.

# Implementation details
## Chapter1
* `fib4.py` is an implementation that uses Python's decorators, so porting is omitted.
* `fib6.py` is an implementation that uses Python's generators, so porting is omitted.

# Goal
Apply features from modern C++ wherever possible.
